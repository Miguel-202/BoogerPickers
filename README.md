## Project Description

The Rizzard is a game project made using Unreal Engine 5.1, utilizing both C++ and Blueprints for development. The game features various gameplay mechanics, including different damage types, health and mana components, casting mechanics, spell switching with UI through mouse input, and different reactions of the environment through spells.

### Puzzle Examples

Here are some examples of puzzles that we will implement in the game, with elemental powers needed and increasing difficulty over time:

**Puzzle 1 - Windmill Puzzle**
- Elemental powers needed: Air
- Difficulty: Easy
- Description: This puzzle involves a windmill that the player needs to activate using the air spell. The player must navigate through the environment and use their air spell to activate the windmill's blades, which will open doors and progress through the level. The puzzle requires timing and accuracy to activate the windmill's blades correctly.

### AI Mechanics

In addition to the puzzles, the game also includes AI mechanics where the player must fight against enemies. This mechanic adds an element of challenge and combat to the gameplay experience.

### Design

The AI mechanics in The Rizzard are designed to provide engaging combat encounters for the player. Various enemy types and behaviors will be implemented, requiring the player to strategize and use their spells and abilities effectively to defeat them.

### Spells and Abilities

The player will have access to a range of spells and abilities to fight against the AI enemies. These spells and abilities will be designed to complement the combat mechanics and provide a diverse gameplay experience.
